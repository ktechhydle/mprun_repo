<h1>About MPRUN</h1>

<p>Development started late January of 2024, when athlete Keller Hydle started programming an idea he had in mind for
      years; a competition run planning app. The idea was born when Keller's Dad, Jeremy Hydle, created a trick planning
      sheet template that could be printed out on paper and drawn on.
      <br><br>
      As you may know, everything is in a constant change. That's why MPRUN was created, to help improve adapting to
      this constant change.
      <br><br>
      Tricks are getting harder in competitions, and nowadays mental game is 90% part of it. Our main goal is to help
      increase the performance of your mental game by using a simple technic, Physical Visualization. Physical
      Visualization (PZ), is the process of taking something we normally visualize in our brain and putting it on a
      physical object (like a piece of paper). MPRUN does exactly that, where you draw your competition run and print it
      out to a piece of paper and/or save it to your phone.
      <br><br>
      PZ does not guarantee perfect results; it is a tool that can be used to ASSIST athletes (our full disclaimer can
      be found in the "DISCLAIMER" window shown on startup of MPRUN).
