# Introducing MPRUN - the ultimate competition run planning software for on-snow athletes
## But what is that?

MPRUN's intention is to **help athletes create proper mindsets** going into competitions.

Tricks are getting harder in competitions, and nowadays _mental game is 90% part of it_. Our main goal is to help increase the performance of your mental game by using a simple technic, **Physical Visualization**.

**Physical Visualization (PZ)**, is the process of taking something we normally visualize in our brain and putting it on a physical object (like a piece of paper). MPRUN does exactly that, where you draw your competition run and print it out to a piece of paper. You can even export your run and save it to your phone.

> [!WARNING]
> PZ does not guarantee perfect results; it is a tool that can be used to ASSIST athletes (our full disclaimer can be found in the "DISCLAIMER" window shown on startup of MPRUN).

## Why does it exist?

As you may know, everything is in a constant change. That's why MPRUN was created, to help improve adapting to this constant change. 

It doesn't help everybody, but as an on-snow athlete myself, I know it can assist those that struggle in competition environments reduce stress and pressure to perform.

## How does it work? 

_You can find a demo video on <kbd>[MPRUN's website↗️](https://sites.google.com/view/mprun/home)</kbd>, but here's a simplification on how the process works._

1. Create your course
> Use a drag and drop editor to drag **Course Elements** on to the scene (**Course Elements** are just SVG items representing course features like rails, jumps, and even halfpipes)

2. Draw your line
> Use line drawing tools to draw your "path" along the course (where your going to ride, what features your going to hit)

3. Label your line
> Use labelling tools to label your tricks along your "path" (what tricks you do on each feature)

#### And that's it! You can then export your run and print it out to a piece of paper.

a 'whatever' mentality and fostering a focused mindset for competitions.
