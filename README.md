# Contributing
Contributions are appreciated! However, they are not expected. MPRUN and the MP Software Foundation Project
have goals and future development plans beyond community contributions. Our intention is to ***build*** a software,
not rely on someone else to update and fix our project for us. _We aren't being mean, we just want to finish what we 
started._
