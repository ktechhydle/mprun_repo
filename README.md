# Additional Features
- Vector Graphics:
	> MPRUN uses a Vector Graphics Engine (`QGraphicsScene`), making the use of SVG's a better choice.
- Item management:
	> Items are named according to their current state (Locked, Grouped, etc.)
- Elements are named:
	> You will often see elements named `Editable Text Block` or `Free MPRUN Element` on the Canvas. ***Hover your mouse over an element to see the element name.***
- Insert different files:
	> Insert PNG, JPEG, SVG, or even TIFF files onto the canvas.
- Export multiple file types:
	> Export the canvas as a PNG, JPEG, SVG, or even a PDF file (beta).
- Add text blocks:
	> Add Editable Text Block's on to the Canvas.
> [!TIP] 
> > Enable `GSNAP` in the action toolbar to enable grid-snapping for grouped items.

# Why MPRUN Though?
MPRUN can build a solid plan going into competitions, creating a proper mindset for athletes.
#### Why is that important though? 
This step is crucial to ensure athletes don't go into competitions without a plan and a 'just wing it' mindset.

# TL;DR

> MPRUN is a comprehensive software designed for planning snowboard and ski competition runs. Users can customize courses, draw their path, label tricks, and lock elements for optimal performance. It promotes strategic planning for athletes, preventing a 'just wing it' mentality and fostering a focused mindset for competitions.
